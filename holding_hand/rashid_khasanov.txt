KAs a non-coder, I used to spend about $5K to build an MVP by hiring tech people. 

I just vibe-coded a fully functional app in 2 days and it cost me less than $50. 

AI is not a threat, it's a pure leverage. 

App turns old images into animated videos.

Has anyone tested a $1 trial that worked well?

On Investor Hunt, the number of failed payments is getting out of hand.

Considering to test that to eliminate low-intent users.
